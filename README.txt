Work to analyze structure of innovation and creativity using citation databases
for patents and publications.

Current works focusing on using the NBER patent database (Hall, Jaffe and
Trajtenberg).

## Files

Generally comments are in files but some exceptions:

* missing_patents.txt: list of patent numbers which are in the cite file but
  *not* in the patent file (and so needed to be added in when building the db).
  Originate from code in the convert_to_db.py file.
